Our team is TechStorm!
Our members are:

Dessislav Alexsandrov

.


Our mission was to create a project, from which you can play games.
.

We made the whole project using c++.


. 


First of all discussed our project then Raya started doing the design of the games.
Later Dessislav and Vikor started working on the project.
After a few sessions we were finally done with our job. It took some time, but it was well worth it!
.


We hope you enjoy it!
