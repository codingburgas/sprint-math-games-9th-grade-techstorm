Our mission was to create a project, from wich you can play games.
.

We made the whole project using c++.
. 


First of all we went to Dessislav's apartament and discussed our project, a few days later we again went to Dessislav's apartament and started working on the project, Dessislav and Vikor were creating the project, while Raya and Anastas were supporting it by designing the games.
After a few sessions we were finally done with our job. It took some time, but it was well worth it!
.


We hope you enjoy it!
